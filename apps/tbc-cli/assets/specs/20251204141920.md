## Specifications

- Method Name: Gather Context
- Purpose: To provide the necessary context at the start of every interaction.
- Actors: Agent (primary), Prime User (if manual)
- Steps:
  - To be used at the start of every interaction.
  - May be used during the interaction for additional information.
  - To be used using the `vault` system methods.
  - IF TBC CLI Engagment System is available
    - use the 'Probe Environment' Method
  - The TBC System Definitions and Root Record from `vault` will be provided as context at the start of the interaction.
  - If the interaction's interface does not do it automatically, the Prime User will be responsible for providing the context.
  - If the Root Record does not have the Agent Identity and Motivation inline, they should be retrieved using `vault`.
