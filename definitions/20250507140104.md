# Vault System Definition 1.0

The purpose of a Vault and its Records is to provide a future proof format and system to "record" events, occurrences and data.

## Specifications

- this system refers to the Vault System
- the system must provide operations specified in [Methods](#methods)
- the system must use plain-text format for operations
- the system may use any implementation for storage
- the system's records in operations must have fields specified in [Schema](#schema); records may be in Markdown format in which case the front matter will have all fields except content
- the fields specified must not be restricted by other systems using or extending this system
- the methods may be restricted by any rules specified in other systems using this system

## Schema

- [id](./20250507141631.md)
	- required
- [content](./20250507144249.md)
	- optional

## Actors

- User - any user of this system

## Methods

- Fetch Record By ID
  - allow any Actor specified in [Actors](#actors) to fetch record by `id` specified in [Schema](#schema)
- Fetch All Record IDs
  - allow any Actor specified in  [Actors](#actors) to fetch all record `id` specified in [Schema](#schema) in context of the system
- Store Record By ID
  - allow any Actor specified in [Actors](#actors) to store record fields specified in [Schema](#schema)
  - if the system already has the record with given `id` it will be updated, else a new record would be created
## Non-Specification Considerations

This section outlines ideas and open-ended considerations that are not part of the core specification but may influence future versions, extensions, or implementations of the Vault System.

### Record Type Expansion

- Other extensions or systems may introduce distinct record categories and specify values.
### Uniqueness Scope

- Record `id` values are unique within an instance of Vault, ensuring flexibility.
- Any concerns regarding global uniqueness across multiple systems should be handled by the compositing system rather than Vault itself.

### Storage Implementation

- While the Vault System allows any implementation for storage, future versions (v1.1 or v2.0) may introduce recommendations for indexing or retrieval efficiency.
- An extension could enforce archival and state-tracking mechanisms.

### Method Extension

- The Large Vault System could refine Markdown handling rules for structured workflows.
- Considerations for processing multi-file linking or reserved characters might emerge if Vault scales beyond its initial scope.

These are not strict specifications but rather guiding thoughts for evolving the Vault System without restricting its core flexibility.
